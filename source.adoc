.Gettysburg Address
[[gettysburg]]
[quote, Abraham Lincoln, Address delivered at the dedication of the Cemetery at Gettysburg]
____
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation...

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure. ...

=== Images



To include an image on its own line (i.e., a block image), use the image:: prefix in front of the file name and square brackets after it:

----
image::sunset.jpg[]
----

If you want to specify alt text, include it inside the square brackets:

----
image::sunset.jpg[Sunset]
----
